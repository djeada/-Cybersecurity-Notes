Port Scanning

Metasploit has a number of modules to scan open ports on the target system and network. You can list potential port scanning modules available using the search portscan command.

Port scanning modules will require you to set a few options:
Portscan options

           
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) > show options

Module options (auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp):

   Name         Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----         ---------------  --------  -----------
   CONCURRENCY  10               yes       The number of concurrent ports to check per host
   DELAY        0                yes       The delay between connections, per thread, in milliseconds
   JITTER       0                yes       The delay jitter factor (maximum value by which to +/- DELAY) in milliseconds.
   PORTS        1-10000          yes       Ports to scan (e.g. 22-25,80,110-900)
   RHOSTS                        yes       The target host(s), range CIDR identifier, or hosts file with syntax 'file:'
   THREADS      1                yes       The number of concurrent threads (max one per host)
   TIMEOUT      1000             yes       The socket connect timeout in milliseconds

msf6 auxiliary(scanner/portscan/tcp) >

        


    CONCURRENCY: Number of targets to be scanned simultaneously.
    PORTS: Port range to be scanned. Please note that 1-1000 here will not be the same as using Nmap with the default configuration. Nmap will scan the 1000 most used ports, while Metasploit will scan port numbers from 1 to 10000.
    RHOSTS: Target or target network to be scanned.
    THREADS: Number of threads that will be used simultaneously. More threads will result in faster scans.

You can directly perform Nmap scans from the msfconsole prompt as shown below faster:

As for information gathering, if your engagement requires a speedier approach to port scanning, Metasploit may not be your first choice. However, a number of modules make Metasploit a useful tool for the scanning phase.

UDP service Identification

The scanner/discovery/udp_sweep module will allow you to quickly identify services running over the UDP (User Datagram Protocol). As you can see below, this module will not conduct an extensive scan of all possible UDP services but does provide a quick way to identify services such as DNS or NetBIOS.
UDP scan

           
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/discovery/udp_sweep) > run

[*] Sending 13 probes to 10.10.12.229->10.10.12.229 (1 hosts)
[*] Discovered NetBIOS on 10.10.12.229:137 (JON-PC::U :WORKGROUP::G :JON-PC::U :WORKGROUP::G :WORKGROUP::U :__MSBROWSE__::G :02:ce:59:27:c8:e3)
[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/discovery/udp_sweep) >

        


SMB Scans

Metasploit offers several useful auxiliary modules that allow us to scan specific services. Below is an example for the SMB. Especially useful in a corporate network would be smb_enumshares and smb_version but please spend some time to identify scanners that the Metasploit version installed on your system offers.
SMB scan

           
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > run

[+] 10.10.12.229:445      - Host is running Windows 7 Professional SP1 (build:7601) (name:JON-PC) (workgroup:WORKGROUP ) (signatures:optional)
[*] 10.10.12.229:445      - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) >

        


When performing service scans, it would be important not to omit more "exotic" services such as NetBIOS. NetBIOS (Network Basic Input Output System), similar to SMB, allows computers to communicate over the network to share files or send files to printers. The NetBIOS name of the target system can give you an idea about its role and even importance (e.g. CORP-DC, DEVOPS, SALES, etc.). You may also run across some shared files and folders that could be accessed either without a password or protected with a simple password (e.g. admin, administrator, root, toor, etc.).
