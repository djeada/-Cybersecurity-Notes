## Sock Puppets

A "sock puppet" refers to a fake online persona created to deceive or manipulate others. Sock puppets are commonly used in social engineering, OSINT investigations, or to covertly interact with individuals or organizations without revealing the true identity of the operator. Creating and managing sock puppets requires careful planning and adherence to security best practices to avoid detection and compromise.

### Best Practices for Sock Puppet Operations

1. Develop your sock puppet’s online presence over time, just like a real person would. Avoid creating multiple accounts and interacting with numerous people immediately after creation.
2. Ensure that all aspects of the sock puppet’s online presence (social media profiles, backstory, interests) are consistent and believable. Avoid contradictions that could raise red flags.
3. Regularly monitor the interactions and responses to the sock puppet to adjust behavior if necessary and avoid detection.
4. Avoid engaging in activities that could attract unwanted attention or expose the sock puppet to intensive scrutiny, such as hacking groups or sensitive government forums.
5. Be ready to abandon and delete the sock puppet if it becomes compromised or if there’s a risk of exposure. Never tie it to anything that could compromise your real identity.
1. To avoid linking the sock puppet to your real identity, always use a separate browser and, ideally, a different IP address (e.g., via VPN or Tor) when operating the fake persona.
2. Never use your personal phone, email, or any other identifiable information when creating or managing a sock puppet. Always use entirely separate, untraceable accounts and devices.
3. Avoid searching for or interacting with people related to your real life when using a sock puppet. This could inadvertently link the fake persona back to you.
