### RSA - Rivest Shamir Adleman

**Mathematical Foundation:**
- RSA is based on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers. While it's easy to multiply two primes together, finding the original primes given their product is computationally hard.

**Key Variables in RSA:**
- **p and q:** Large prime numbers.
- **n:** The product of p and q, used in both public and private keys.
- **e:** A public exponent, part of the public key.
- **d:** A private exponent, part of the private key.
- **m:** The plaintext message.
- **c:** The ciphertext, or encrypted message.
