## Anonymous Browsing

### Key Practices for Maintaining Anonymity

1. **Avoid Assigning Identifiers:**
   - **No Personal Identifiers:** Don’t link your browser activity to identifiable information like email addresses, social media accounts, or anything that can be traced back to you.
   - **Separate Accounts:** If you must use accounts, create new ones with no personal information attached.

2. **Be Aware of Online Habits:**
   - **Login Locations:** Avoid logging into accounts from recognizable or consistent locations, such as the same public Wi-Fi network or library.
   - **Avoid Personal Photos:** Don’t upload real photos of yourself.
   - **Style Consistency:** Be mindful of your writing style and other consistent behaviors that can create a recognizable pattern.

3. **Use a Live OS on a USB Stick:**
   - **Live OS for Privacy:** Running a live OS like Tails from a USB stick ensures that no browsing history or data is stored on the computer.
   - **MAC Address Randomization:** Using a Live OS like Tails, which randomizes your MAC address, further helps in avoiding tracking.
