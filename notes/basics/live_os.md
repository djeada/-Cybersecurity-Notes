## Live OS with No Permanent Storage

### Overview

- **Live OS:** A Live OS is an operating system that runs entirely from a USB stick, DVD, or other temporary storage, without installing anything on the computer's hard drive.
- **No Permanent Storage:** These systems do not save any data to the hard drive, ensuring that all activities and data are lost after shutdown, enhancing privacy and security.

### Example: Linux Tails

- **What is Tails?** 
  - Tails (The Amnesic Incognito Live System) is a security-focused Linux distribution designed to protect your privacy and anonymity.
  - It is specifically built to run as a Live OS, leaving no trace on the computer after use.

- **Key Features:**
  - **No Permanent Storage:** All data is stored in RAM and erased upon shutdown.
  - **Anonymity Tools:** Includes tools like Tor for anonymous browsing.
  - **MAC Address Randomization:** Tails randomizes your MAC address to prevent tracking of your network hardware, adding an extra layer of privacy.

- **Use Cases:** Ideal for situations requiring high privacy, such as secure communication, anonymous browsing, or when using potentially untrusted machines.
