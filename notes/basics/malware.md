### Types of Malware

Understanding the various types of malware is essential for protecting systems. Here are the main categories:

1. **Viruses**
   - Malicious code executed by the user, typically attached to a file.
   - **Types of Viruses:**
     - **Boot Sector:** Resides in the first sector of the hard drive.
     - **Macro:** Embedded within documents, often in word processors.
     - **Program:** Infects executable files.
     - **Encrypted:** Uses encryption to avoid detection.
     - **Polymorphic:** Changes its decryption module with every infection to evade detection.
     - **Metamorphic:** Alters its entire code with each infection, making it difficult to detect.
     - **Stealth:** Conceals itself to avoid detection by antivirus software.
     - **Armored:** Misdirects antivirus tools from detecting its true location.
     - **Multipartite:** A hybrid virus that infects both the boot sector and programs.

2. **Worms**
   - Standalone malicious programs that replicate themselves and may spread automatically without user intervention.

3. **Trojans**
   - Malicious software disguised as legitimate or beneficial applications.
   - **Examples:**
     - **Keygens:** Software that generates activation keys but may contain hidden malware.
     - **RAT (Remote Access Trojans):** Trojans that provide attackers remote access to infected systems.

4. **Ransomware**
   - Malware that encrypts files and data, demanding payment for decryption keys.
   - Often spreads as a Trojan or worm.

5. **Spyware**
   - Typically hidden within third-party applications, it logs user activities and sends the information to attackers.
   - Often associated with adware and grayware.

6. **Rootkits**
   - Designed to gain and maintain administrative control over a computer system.
   - **Characteristics:**
     - Hard to detect due to its low-level targeting (UEFI/BIOS, kernel, etc.).
     - Activates before the operating system or antivirus software.

7. **Spam**
   - The misuse of electronic messaging systems to send unsolicited messages, often containing malicious content.

### Malware Delivery

**Threat Vector vs. Attack Vector:**
- **Threat Vector:** The path through which malware reaches a target.
- **Attack Vector:** The specific method or technique used to exploit vulnerabilities.

**Common Delivery Methods:**
- **Software, Messaging, and Media:**
  - Emails, FTP, P2P, and torrent file downloads.
  - Removable media (USB drives, external hard drives).
- **Typosquatting:** Exploiting mistyped URLs to distribute malware.
- **Exploit Kits:** Tools that automate the exploitation of vulnerabilities.
- **Botnets and Zombies:** Networks of compromised devices used for Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks or financial gain.
- **Active Interception (MITM):** Man-in-the-Middle attacks that intercept and alter communications.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining higher access levels within a system.
- **Backdoor:** An intentional loophole in a system that allows unauthorized access.
- **Logic Bombs:** Malware triggered by specific conditions (e.g., date, operating system type).

### Malware Prevention and Troubleshooting

**Common Symptoms:**
- Slow computer performance.
- Frequent crashes or system instability.
- Unexpected changes to the homepage.
- Pop-up ads and other unsolicited content.

**Common Prevention Methods:**
- **Antivirus Software:**
  - Regular updates and scans.
  - Detects worms, viruses, and Trojans.
  - **Limitations:** May not detect botnet activity, rootkits, or logic bombs.
- **Firewalls and Regular OS Updates:**
  - Protect against unauthorized access and vulnerabilities.
- **Separation of OS and Data:**
  - Prevents the spread of malware to critical data.
- **Hardware and Software-Based Firewalls:**
  - Example: Router (hardware) and Windows Firewall (software).
- **Encryption:**
  - For confidentiality, use tools like Windows Encrypting File System (EFS).

**Common Steps to Malware Removal:**
1. **Identify Symptoms:** Determine if the system is infected.
2. **Quarantine the Infected System:** Isolate the system or drive to prevent further spread.
3. **Disable System Restore:** Prevent reinfection by disabling restore points.
4. **Remediate the Affected System:** 
   - Update antivirus software.
   - Perform a full system scan and remove detected malware.
5. **Schedule Scans and Run Updates:** Ensure ongoing protection.
6. **Enable System Restore:** Create a new restore point after cleaning.
7. **Educate End Users:** Teach users how to avoid future infections.

### Specific Malware Types and Their Prevention

- **Worms and Trojans:**
  - Use antivirus software, perform regular maintenance, and stay vigilant.
- **Spyware:**
  - Enhance browser security settings, remove unnecessary applications, and educate end users.
- **Rootkits:**
  - Use antivirus software and specialized rootkit detectors (e.g., USB bootable OS).
  - Prefer UEFI over BIOS (GPT over MBR).
  - In extreme cases, wipe the entire drive and reinstall the operating system.
- **Spam:**
  - Use spam filters, implement whitelisting/blacklisting, and close open mail relays.
