## Securing Web Browsers

### General Browser Security Procedures
1. **Avoid Newest Versions and Disable Auto-Update:**
   - New browser versions may be unstable; evaluate before deployment.
2. **Consider Organizational Requirements and OS:**
   - Choose browsers that align with your organization's security policies.
3. **Implement Policies:**
   - Use handwritten rules, browser settings, GPO (Group Policy Objects in Windows), and OS settings to enforce security measures.
4. **Train Users:**
   - Educate users on safe browsing practices and potential threats.
5. **Use Proxy and Content Filters:**
   - Proxy servers act as intermediaries between clients and servers, caching data to improve security and performance. 
   - Configure proxies in browser settings or through a domain controller. Beware of malicious proxy configurations.
6. **Secure Against Malicious Code:**
   - Restrict or configure the use of Java, ActiveX, JavaScript, and Flash to prevent code execution vulnerabilities.

### Web Browser Concerns and Security Methods
1. **Basic Methods:**
   - Keep browsers updated in a timely manner.
   - Use ad blockers and pop-up blockers.
   - Implement security zones to separate trusted and untrusted sites.
   - Control ActiveX, Java, and other plugins.
   - Avoid jailbreaking or rooting mobile devices.

2. **Cookies:**
   - Manage and control cookies through browser settings.
   - Be aware of session hijacking threats associated with cookies.

3. **Locally Shared Objects (LSO - Flash):**
   - Flash's version of cookies, which can be used for tracking users.
   - Configure and control these in the Flash Player Settings Manager.

4. **Add-ons and Plugins:**
   - Inherent security risks; disable unnecessary add-ons.
   - Be cautious with Internet Explorer plugins, especially those using ActiveX, as they are often vulnerable.

### Advanced Browser Security
1. **Browser Temporary Files:**
   - Configure browsers to automatically delete temporary files upon exit.
2. **Disable Saved Passwords:**
   - Prevent browsers from storing passwords to reduce the risk of credential theft.
3. **Configure TLS/SSL:**
   - Set a minimum version limit to ensure secure encryption protocols are used.
4. **Disable Third-Party Plugins:**
   - Enhance security by restricting the use of third-party plugins.
5. **Use VPNs or Virtual Machines:**
   - For additional separation and security, consider using VPNs or virtual environments.
