## Passwords

Passwords are one of the most common and fundamental mechanisms for securing access to systems, applications, and data. However, they are also one of the most targeted by attackers due to human factors, such as the use of weak or reused passwords. For penetration testers, passwords represent a critical point of focus in evaluating the security posture of an organization.

### Common Locations Where Passwords May Be Stored

When performing a penetration test or security audit, it's crucial to identify all potential locations where passwords might be stored. Below are some common places where passwords can be found:

1. **Configuration Files:**
   - **.env Files:** Often used in web applications to store environment variables, including database credentials and API keys. Location: Root directory of the application (e.g., `/var/www/html/.env`).
   - **config.php / config.py / config.yml:** Configuration files for web applications or frameworks may store database credentials, SMTP credentials, and other sensitive information. Location: Typically found in the application’s root or config directories.
   - **web.config / app.config:** Configuration files for ASP.NET and other applications that may contain plaintext passwords. Location: Web application root directory or `/etc` for Linux-based systems.
   - **settings.py:** Common in Django projects, this file may store database and other sensitive credentials. Location: Within the Django project directory.
   - **wp-config.php:** Specific to WordPress installations, this file stores the database credentials and other sensitive information. Location: Root directory of the WordPress installation.

2. **Operating System Files:**
   - **/etc/shadow:** Linux file that stores hashed user passwords. Only accessible by the root user or processes with elevated privileges. Location: `/etc/shadow`.
   - **/etc/passwd:** While this file used to store passwords, modern systems only store user account information here, with passwords stored in `/etc/shadow`. Location: `/etc/passwd`.
   - **SAM (Security Account Manager) File:** Windows file that stores hashed passwords. Location: `C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM`.
   - **Registry:** In Windows, certain applications may store passwords in the registry. Location: Specific registry keys such as `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software`, `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software`.

3. **Database Files:**
   - **MySQL / MariaDB Databases:** Passwords might be stored in user tables or configurations within the database. Common tables include `mysql.user`.
   - **PostgreSQL / pg_hba.conf:** Configuration files or user tables within the database may contain sensitive credentials.
   - **MongoDB / .dbshell:** A MongoDB configuration file that may store credentials. Location: Home directory of the MongoDB user.

4. **Application and Service Logs:**
   - **Application Logs:** Sometimes, misconfigured applications may log sensitive information like passwords. Location: `/var/log/`, `C:\ProgramData\`, or within the application’s directory.
   - **Service Logs:** Logs for services like FTP, SSH, or SQL servers may inadvertently store plaintext passwords. Location: `/var/log/secure`, `/var/log/auth.log`.

5. **Credential Storage Services and Files:**
   - **AWS Credentials:** Stored in plain text in the `~/.aws/credentials` file for AWS CLI. Location: User’s home directory.
   - **SSH Keys:** While not passwords, private SSH keys are sensitive and stored in `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. Location: User’s home directory.
   - **Windows Credential Manager:** Stores credentials for various services and applications. Location: Accessible via the Control Panel or `cmdkey` command.
   - **KeePass / Password Managers:** While encrypted, these files contain passwords and must be securely stored. Location: User-defined.

6. **Web Browser Storage:**
   - **Browser Password Manager:** Modern web browsers often store saved passwords locally. Location: Browser-specific directories like `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\` for Chrome.
   - **Cookies and Local Storage:** Web applications may store session tokens or, in rare cases, passwords in cookies or local storage. Location: Browser-specific local storage.

7. **Backup Files:**
   - **Database Backups:** Often, backups may contain unencrypted passwords if the database itself wasn’t secure. Location: Backup directories, `/var/backups/`, `C:\Backup\`.
   - **Configuration Backups:** Old or misconfigured backups may still contain plaintext passwords. Location: `/etc/backup/`, `/var/backups/`, or user-defined locations.

8. **Source Code Repositories:**
   - **Git Repositories (.git/config, .git/credentials):** Passwords might be accidentally committed to version control. Location: `.git/` directory or within source code files.
   - **CI/CD Pipelines:** Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines may store credentials in plain text within build scripts. Location: `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, etc.

9. **Cloud Service Storage:**
   - **Cloud Environment Variables:** Cloud services like AWS Lambda, Heroku, or Azure Functions may store credentials in environment variables. Location: Service-specific dashboards.
   - **Cloud Metadata Services:** Some cloud services expose credentials via metadata services if not properly secured. Location: `http://169.254.169.254/` (AWS).

### Common Password Vulnerabilities

1. **Weak Passwords:**
   - **Description:** Passwords that are easily guessable, such as "password123", "admin", or "123456". These passwords are vulnerable to dictionary and brute-force attacks.
   - **Impact:** Weak passwords can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access quickly without needing advanced techniques.

2. **Password Reuse:**
   - **Description:** Using the same password across multiple accounts or systems. If one account is compromised, attackers can use the same credentials to access other systems.
   - **Impact:** Password reuse significantly increases the risk of a cascading breach across multiple services.

3. **Default Credentials:**
   - **Description:** Many systems and applications come with default usernames and passwords (e.g., "admin/admin"). Failure to change these defaults creates an easy entry point for attackers.
   - **Impact:** Attackers often try default credentials first, as they can provide immediate access to the system.

4. **Unhashed or Poorly Hashed Passwords:**
   - **Description:** Storing passwords in plaintext or using weak hashing algorithms like MD5 or SHA1 without proper salting.
   - **Impact:** If the password database is compromised, attackers can easily retrieve plaintext passwords or crack poorly hashed passwords.

5. **Insecure Password Reset Mechanisms:**
   - **Description:** Password reset processes that are easily bypassed or do not adequately verify the user’s identity, such as using easily guessed security questions.
   - **Impact:** Attackers can exploit these mechanisms to reset and gain control of user accounts.

### Password Attack Techniques

1. **Brute-Force Attacks:**
   - **Description:** An attacker systematically tries all possible combinations of characters until the correct password is found.
   - **Tools:** Hydra, John the Ripper, Hashcat.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement account lockout mechanisms, use CAPTCHAs, and enforce strong password policies.

2. **Dictionary Attacks:**
   - **Description:** A type of brute-force attack that uses a list of commonly used passwords or wordlists to guess the password.
   - **Tools:** Cain & Abel, John the Ripper, Burp Suite.
   - **Mitigation:** Encourage users to create complex passwords that are not based on dictionary words.

3. **Credential Stuffing:**
   - **Description:** Attackers use a list of previously compromised username-password pairs from other breaches to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
   - **Tools:** Sentry MBA, Snipr, STORM.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA), monitor for unusual login patterns, and encourage unique passwords for different services.

4. **Rainbow Table Attacks:**
   - **Description:** An attacker uses precomputed tables (rainbow tables) of hashed passwords to crack passwords stored in hashed form.
   - **Tools:** RainbowCrack, Ophcrack.
   - **Mitigation:** Use strong hashing algorithms like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2 with a salt.

5. **Phishing Attacks:**
   - **Description:** Social engineering techniques where attackers trick users into revealing their passwords through deceptive emails, websites, or messages.
   - **Tools:** SET (Social Engineering Toolkit), Gophish.
   - **Mitigation:** Educate users about phishing, use email filtering, and deploy MFA.

6. **Password Spraying:**
   - **Description:** Attackers attempt to access many accounts by trying a small number of common passwords (e.g., "password123") against many usernames.
   - **Tools:** Burp Suite, CrackMapExec.
   - **Mitigation:** Monitor for unusual login attempts, enforce strong password policies, and implement account lockout thresholds.

### Best Practices for Password Security

1. **Enforce Strong Password Policies:**
   - **Description:** Require passwords to be of a certain length, include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - **Guidelines:** NIST recommends a minimum of 8 characters, but longer passwords (12-16 characters) are generally more secure.

2. **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
   - **Description:** Adding an additional layer of security (e.g., SMS codes, authenticator apps) beyond just a password.
   - **Impact:** Even if a password is compromised, MFA provides an additional barrier that attackers must overcome.

3. **Regular Password Rotation:**
   - **Description:** Require users to change their passwords periodically. However, this practice should be balanced against the risk of users creating weaker passwords to meet rotation requirements.
   - **Best Practice:** Focus on detecting compromised passwords rather than frequent changes.

4. **Password Managers:**
   - **Description:** Encourage the use of password managers to generate and store complex, unique passwords for each service.
   - **Tools:** LastPass, Bitwarden, KeePass.
   - **Impact:** Reduces the risk of password reuse and encourages stronger password choices.

5. **Secure Password Storage:**
   - **Description:** Store passwords using strong, salted hashes. Avoid storing passwords in plaintext or using weak hashing algorithms.
   - **Best Practices:** Use bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2 for hashing passwords, and ensure that salts are unique and random for each password.

6. **Implement Account Lockout Mechanisms:**
   - **Description:** Temporarily lock accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
   - **Considerations:** Implement progressive delays or CAPTCHAs to avoid locking legitimate users out due to multiple failed attempts.
