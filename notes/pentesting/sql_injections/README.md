## SQL Injection

SQL Injection (SQLi) is a code injection technique that exploits vulnerabilities in an application's software by manipulating the SQL (Structured Query Language) queries. Attackers can use SQLi to bypass application security measures, retrieve, modify, or delete data from the database, and, in some cases, gain administrative control over the application.

### Types of SQL Injections

1. **In-Band SQL Injection:**
   - **Description:** The most common type, where the attacker uses the same communication channel to both inject the malicious SQL code and retrieve the results.
   - **Subtypes:**
     - **Error-Based SQL Injection:** Relies on database error messages to reveal information about the database structure.
     - **Union-Based SQL Injection:** Uses the UNION SQL operator to combine the results of a malicious query with a legitimate one, allowing attackers to extract data.

2. **Blind SQL Injection:**
   - **Description:** Used when the application does not return error messages or the results of the SQL query directly. Attackers deduce information based on the applicationâ€™s behavior.
   - **Subtypes:**
     - **Boolean-Based Blind SQL Injection:** The attacker sends SQL queries that result in either true or false conditions and observes the application's response to infer the database structure.
     - **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection:** Involves sending queries that force the database to wait (using functions like `SLEEP()`) before responding, allowing attackers to infer information based on the time taken by the response.

3. **Out-of-Band SQL Injection:**
   - **Description:** Used when in-band SQL injection is not possible. The attacker uses a different communication channel (e.g., DNS or HTTP requests) to retrieve data from the database. This type is less common but can be more dangerous as it is harder to detect.

### Common SQL Injection Techniques

1. **Tautology-Based Injection:**
   - **Description:** An attacker injects a query that always evaluates to true, typically using the `OR` operator, which allows them to bypass authentication or extract data.
   - **Example:** `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR '1' = '1';`

2. **Union-Based Injection:**
   - **Description:** This technique uses the `UNION` SQL operator to combine malicious queries with legitimate ones, allowing the attacker to extract additional data from the database.
   - **Example:** `SELECT name, address FROM users WHERE id = 1 UNION SELECT username, password FROM admin;`

3. **Piggybacked Queries:**
   - **Description:** The attacker appends additional queries to an original query using the `;` delimiter, potentially altering or destroying data.
   - **Example:** `SELECT * FROM users; DROP TABLE users;`

4. **Blind SQL Injection:**
   - **Description:** The attacker sends crafted queries to trigger true/false conditions or time delays, gathering information based on the response behavior rather than direct output.
   - **Example:** `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1 AND 1=IF(SUBSTR(database(), 1, 1)='t', SLEEP(5), 0);`

5. **Error-Based Injection:**
   - **Description:** Exploits error messages returned by the database to gather information about the database structure and data.
   - **Example:** `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1' AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users) = 1; -- This may produce an error that reveals the number of users in the database.`

### Impact of SQL Injection Attacks

SQL injection attacks can have severe consequences for both the application and the organization, including:

1. **Data Theft:** Attackers can extract sensitive information, such as user credentials, financial details, or personally identifiable information (PII).
2. **Data Loss or Corruption:** SQLi can lead to unauthorized data modification or deletion, causing data loss or corruption.
3. **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers may gain administrative control over the application, leading to further exploitation.
4. **Reputation Damage:** A successful SQL injection attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and erode user trust.
5. **Legal and Financial Consequences:** Non-compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR can result in hefty fines and legal actions.

### Preventing SQL Injection

1. **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**
   - **Description:** Use parameterized queries to separate SQL code from data input, preventing attackers from injecting malicious SQL.
   - **Example:** `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?;`

2. **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
   - **Description:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs to ensure they meet expected formats and do not contain malicious content.
   - **Techniques:**
     - **Whitelist Validation:** Only allow inputs that match predefined patterns or values.
     - **Escaping Input:** Use functions to escape potentially dangerous characters (e.g., quotes).
   
3. **Use of ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):**
   - **Description:** An ORM framework abstracts the database interaction, automatically generating SQL queries and reducing the risk of SQL injection.

4. **Least Privilege Principle:**
   - **Description:** Ensure that database accounts have the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks, limiting the potential damage from an SQL injection attack.

5. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
   - **Description:** Regularly conduct security audits and penetration tests to identify and address vulnerabilities in the application.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - **Description:** Implement robust error handling that does not reveal database error messages or stack traces to the user, thereby limiting the information available to attackers.

### Detecting SQL Injection Attacks

1. **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):**
   - **Description:** Deploy WAFs to monitor and filter out malicious SQL queries before they reach the database.
   
2. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - **Description:** Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring of database activities to detect unusual patterns that may indicate an SQL injection attempt.

3. **Automated Scanning Tools:**
   - **Description:** Use automated tools like SQLMap to detect and identify SQL injection vulnerabilities in your application.

### Real-World SQL Injection Examples

1. **Yahoo (2014):**
   - **Incident:** A vulnerability in Yahoo's website allowed attackers to extract information about users, including email addresses.
   - **Impact:** This incident highlighted the importance of securing web applications against SQLi.

2. **Heartland Payment Systems (2008):**
   - **Incident:** Attackers used SQL injection to breach the payment processing company, leading to the theft of over 130 million credit card numbers.
   - **Impact:** The breach resulted in significant financial losses and led to increased scrutiny of payment processors' security practices.

3. **Sony Pictures (2011):**
   - **Incident:** Attackers used SQL injection to compromise Sony's servers, leading to the leak of personal information of millions of users.
   - **Impact:** The incident caused a major reputational hit to Sony and highlighted the importance of robust security practices.
