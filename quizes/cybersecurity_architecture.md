### Question 1

What is the primary risk of implementing overly restrictive security measures?
1 point

- They can frustrate legitimate users, leading to non-compliance.
- They are difficult to enforce across multiple systems.
- They are more vulnerable to insider threats.
- They increase the likelihood of false positives in threat detection.

---

### Question 2

What is the concept of "Defense in Depth" in cybersecurity?
1 point

- Relying on a single, robust security measure.
- Using multiple layers of security controls to protect data.
- Hiding security controls from potential attackers.
- Focusing all security efforts on the network perimeter.

---

### Question 3

How does a firewall contribute to network security?
1 point

- It encrypts data before it is transmitted over the network.
- It monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.
- It scans files for malware before allowing them to be downloaded.
- It provides secure remote access to the network.

---

### Question 4

What is the role of a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system?
1 point

- It performs regular software updates on all systems.
- It aggregates and analyzes security logs from multiple sources to detect threats.
- It manages user access rights to various systems.
- It encrypts sensitive data to prevent unauthorized access.

---

### Question 5

Which of the following best describes the concept of Zero Trust in cybersecurity architecture?
1 point

- Trusting all users within the network by default.
- Trusting no one by default, verifying every request as if it originates from an open network.
- Automatically granting access to internal users without verification.
- Creating isolated network segments to prevent data breaches.

---

### Question 6

What is the purpose of Network Access Control (NAC) in cybersecurity?
1 point

- To monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.
- To restrict unauthorized devices from connecting to the network.
- To encrypt data during transmission.
- To manage software updates on all connected devices.

---

### Question 7

Which of the following is an example of a phishing attack?
1 point

- Sending a fraudulent email that appears to be from a legitimate source to steal login credentials.
- Overloading a network with traffic to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).
- Infecting a system with malware through a compromised website.
- Gaining physical access to a secured facility using a stolen ID card.

---

### Question 8

What is the function of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) in cybersecurity?
1 point

- It filters out malicious traffic from the internet.
- It creates a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet.
- It scans and removes viruses from connected devices.
- It provides firewall protection for all networked devices.

---

### Question 9

How does Intrusion Detection System (IDS) differ from Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)?
1 point

- IDS only detects potential threats, while IPS can block them.
- IDS blocks threats after detection, while IPS only alerts administrators.
- IDS is a hardware solution, while IPS is software-based.
- IDS requires manual intervention, while IPS operates automatically.

---

### Question 10

What is the primary purpose of implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in a cybersecurity architecture?
1 point

- To encrypt data before transmission.
- To add an additional layer of security by requiring multiple forms of verification before granting access.
- To monitor and log all access attempts.
- To automatically update software to the latest security patches.

---

### Question 11

What is a common method used to protect data in transit within a network?
1 point

- Data masking
- Disk encryption
- Public key infrastructure (PKI)
- Transport Layer Security (TLS)

---

### Question 12

True or False. Network segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller segments to limit the spread of potential breaches.
1 point

- True
- False

---

### Question 13

Which of the following best describes a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack?
1 point

- An attacker intercepts and potentially alters communication between two parties without their knowledge.
- An attacker gains administrative privileges to a system.
- An attacker floods a network with traffic to cause a Denial of Service.
- An attacker plants malware on a compromised system.

---

### Question 14

What is the role of encryption in data security?
1 point

- To detect unauthorized access to data.
- To prevent unauthorized users from modifying data.
- To convert data into a format that is unreadable without a decryption key.
- To ensure that data is available when needed.

---

### Question 15

Which type of malware specifically aims to hold a victim's data or system hostage until a ransom is paid?
1 point

- Spyware
- Adware
- Ransomware
- Trojan horse
